    "# 12 - Integer to Roman\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "    Seven different symbols represent Roman numerals with the following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Symbol\tValue\n",
    "    I\t      1\n",
    "    V\t      5\n",
    "    X\t      10\n",
    "    L\t      50\n",
    "    C\t      100\n",
    "    D\t      500\n",
    "    M\t      1000\n",
    "\n",
    "    Roman numerals are formed by appending the conversions of decimal place values from highest to lowest. \n",
    "    Converting a decimal place value into a Roman numeral has the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the value does not start with 4 or 9, select the symbol of the maximal value that can be subtracted from the input, \n",
    "    append that symbol to the result, subtract its value, and convert the remainder to a Roman numeral.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the value starts with 4 or 9 use the subtractive form representing one symbol subtracted from the following symbol, \n",
    "    for example, 4 is 1 (I) less than 5 (V): IV and 9 is 1 (I) less than 10 (X): IX. \n",
    "    Only the following subtractive forms are used: 4 (IV), 9 (IX), 40 (XL), 90 (XC), 400 (CD) and 900 (CM).\n",
    "    Only powers of 10 (I, X, C, M) can be appended consecutively at most 3 times to represent multiples of 10. \n",
    "    You cannot append 5 (V), 50 (L), or 500 (D) multiple times. If you need to append a symbol 4 times use the subtractive form.\n",
    "    Given an integer, convert it to a Roman numeral.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 1:\n",
    "    Input: num = 3749\n",
    "    Output: \"MMMDCCXLIX\"\n",
    "    Explanation:\n",
    "    3000 = MMM as 1000 (M) + 1000 (M) + 1000 (M)\n",
    "    700 = DCC as 500 (D) + 100 (C) + 100 (C)\n",
    "    40 = XL as 10 (X) less of 50 (L)\n",
    "    9 = IX as 1 (I) less of 10 (X)\n",
    "    Note: 49 is not 1 (I) less of 50 (L) because the conversion is based on decimal places\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example 2:\n",
    "    Input: num = 58\n",
