    "# 138 - Copy List with Random Pointer\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "    A linked list of length n is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, \n",
    "    which could point to any node in the list, or null.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Construct a deep copy of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly n brand new nodes, \n",
    "    where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. \n",
    "    Both the next and random pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list \n",
    "    such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. \n",
    "    None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, if there are two nodes X and Y in the original list, where X.random --> Y, \n",
    "    then for the corresponding two nodes x and y in the copied list, x.random --> y.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return the head of the copied linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. \n",
    "    Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:\n",
    "    - val: an integer representing Node.val\n",
    "    - random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) that the random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your code will only be given the head of the original linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 1:\n",
    "        Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]\n",
    "        Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 2:\n",
    "        Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]\n",
    "        Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 3:\n",
    "        Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]\n",
