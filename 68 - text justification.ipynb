    "# 68 - Text Justification\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "    Given an array of strings words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters \n",
    "    and is fully (left and right) justified.\n",
    "\n",
    "    You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. \n",
    "    Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. \n",
    "    If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, \n",
    "    the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For the last line of text, it should be left-justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.\n",
    "    - Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.\n",
    "    - The input array words contains at least one word.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: words = [\"This\", \"is\", \"an\", \"example\", \"of\", \"text\", \"justification.\"], maxWidth = 16\n",
    "    Output:\n",
    "    [\n",
    "    \"This    is    an\",\n",
    "    \"example  of text\",\n",
    "    \"justification.  \"\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: words = [\"What\",\"must\",\"be\",\"acknowledgment\",\"shall\",\"be\"], maxWidth = 16\n",
    "    Output:\n",

    "    \"acknowledgment  \",\n",
    "    \"shall be        \"\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "    Explanation: Note that the last line is \"shall be    \" instead of \"shall     be\", \n",
    "    because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.\n",
    "    Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: words = [\"Science\",\"is\",\"what\",\"we\",\"understand\",\"well\",\"enough\",\"to\",\"explain\",\"to\",\"a\",\"computer.\",\"Art\",\"is\",\"everything\",\"else\",\"we\",\"do\"], maxWidth = 20\n",
