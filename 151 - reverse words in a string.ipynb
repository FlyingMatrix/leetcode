    "# 151 - Reverse Words in a String\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "    Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.\n",
    "    A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. \n",
    "    The words in s will be separated by at least one space.\n",
    "    Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.\n",
    "    Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. \n",
    "    The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 1:\n",
    "    Input: s = \"the sky is blue\"\n",
    "    Output: \"blue is sky the\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 2:\n",
    "    Input: s = \"  hello world  \"\n",
    "    Output: \"world hello\"\n",
    "    Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example 3:\n",
    "    Input: s = \"a good   example\"\n",
    "    Output: \"example good a\"\n",
    "    Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.\n",
